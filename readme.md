# Lab 3: Web Map Application - COVID in the United States in 2020

For my project, I created 2 interactive maps to depict the different representations of what COVID looked like in the U.S. in the year 2020. For my first map, I made an interactive map that shows the rates of COVID, meaning how many cases were present within 1,000 people in each county. As you can see, when you hover over the map you can see how many cases there are dependent on where your cursur is located on. I utilized the html code structures that was offered for Lab 4 in GEOG 495, which Steven guided me to. The reason behind this is because when I tried to edit the legend and also incorporate the interactive element, I realized it was more intuitive to follow this template than the JS/HTML structures that were givin for this lab since I was making a choropleth map. For my second map, I made a proportional symbols map to show the amount of cases in each county. I followed the given JS structure for this map. The interactivity I incuded was the pop up display of how many cases there are in each county when you physically click on each dot. I also went on QGIS to figure out how to classify my data with the graduated tab under properties with my respective json files.The purpose of this lab was to showcase different interactivity and UX friendliness within a webiste/map. Acknowledgement: The datasources I used were provided within the lab, which are from the US census data. I also looked up how to include a different projection, the information was provided by MapBox on their tutorials. A lot of guidance and instructions were given to me by Steven, my TA, in person.
